                Hey! I'm <strong>Awnry American</strong>. Politics is my passion. Christianity and Stoicism are my foundations. Jesus is my rock and Savior. 
				I decided to start blogging and vlogging because I have been watching and now is the time for those watchman to sound the alarm and defend 
				those freedoms granted by <strong><big> God </big></strong>, not <small>government</small>.

            <h1><span>My Red Pill Moment</span></h1>
            <p>
                <hr/>
					I woke up around 2005. And I'm talking about really saw the light type of woke up..not the virtue signaling "woke".
				Not the Che Guevera t-shirt, anti-capatalist capatilizers (as they listen to their podcasts with their Apple Airpods, sipping $7.00 cups of coffee,
				telling others how the white man opresses everyone)type of woke. Real enlightenment is what I had found. 
			</p>
			</p>
					I was in college when I took the red. I was always stubborn in my core belief system. I knew (and still know) there is
				a right and a wrong. I never lost my belief in moral absolutism, whereas most impressionable youth fall prey to colligiate 
				propaganda pushed through moral relativism. But there are two areas, I've noticed, moral relativists find moral absolution. Those
				are that the white man is evil and God doesn't exist. But I digress...let me get back to my red pill...
			<p>
				It was a hot Kansas summer day...the sun was...nah I'm just kidding. It really was a hot day though. I was driving in my old white
				paint fading pontiac firebird. It was actually a nascar pace car and man I loved it (thank you mom and dad for such a sweet first car).
				The news came out stating how David Koresh, in Waco, TX, and his cult were into illegal firearm sales and, potentially, dealing drugs and the government was 
				going to do something about it. I was confused though because weeks before that, I had heard David was an legal arms dealer. The news media 
				dropped conflicting reports for weeks during the 51 day siege of the Brach Davidians compound. The feds raiding, killed most of the 
				residents. The media said they were bad and it was all David's fault. I said okay. The news is trust worthy that must have been the truth.
				I was on break visiting my parents during this whole beautiful summer day situation where I starting saying "well hold on that info doesn't
				match up". My dad asked me what I knew about it (I think he could see my mind had been twisted a tad from public education concerning big brother).
				And I couldn't really vocalize what I knew, like I said the reports were conflicting. My dad said you need to watch this, and handed me a DVD.
				This film, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waco-Rules-Engagement-William-Gazecki/dp/B0741FHTT1/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?dchild=1&keywords=waco+texas+rules+of+engagement&qid=1602692788&sr=8-1-fkmr1"target'"_blank"><i>Waco Rules Of Engagement</i></a>, rocked my world. 
				This documentary is chalked full of video and audio evidence proving our governemnt attacked first, Koresh regularly visited
				town to trade arms, legally, and the government could have arrested him easily before the siege...if they had anything on him. 
				It showed video evidence of our government flat out lying and then news covering up for their dirty deeds. 
				I encourage you to watch this film. The film is still around today because it is factual. 
				If it was false, the governement (and parties involved) could sue the film maker for liabel and have the documentary removed.
