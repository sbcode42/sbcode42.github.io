                Hey! I'm <strong>Awnry American</strong>. Politics is my passion. Christianity and Stoicism are my foundations. Jesus is my rock and Savior. I decided to start blogging and vlogging because I have been watching and now is the time for those watchman to sound the alarm and defend those freedoms granted by <strong><big> God </big></strong>, not a <small>government</small>.

            <p>
                <hr/>
                I woke up (became actually aware of real life not "woke") at about 23 years old. My redpill moment? My dad telling me to watch a documentary about Waco Texas. I remembered Waco. I remembered always being confused about what was going on and what actually happened. I didn't know at the time, but that is a strategy sued by the left. They keep pumping out inconsistent and even conflicting information. This just causes you to either give up on trying to understand. I remember reports coming out that David was an arms dealer. Then it was he wasn't an arms dealer and he compound was raided for illegal stockpiling and selling arms. But why would the government kill so many people to get to one man? When I look back there were so many questions I should have asked myself such as the previous. This film, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waco-Rules-Engagement-William-Gazecki/dp/B0741FHTT1/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?dchild=1&keywords=waco+texas+rules+of+engagement&qid=1602692788&sr=8-1-fkmr1"target'"_blank"><i>Waco Rules Of Engagement</i></a>, rocked my world. It showed video evidence of our government flat out lying and then news covering up for their dirty deeds. I encourage you to watch this film. The film is still around today because it is factual. If it was false, the governement (and parties involved) could sue the film maker for liabel and have the documentary removed.
